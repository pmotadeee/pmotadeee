### 💡 Explanation of the New Additions

The three new commands are designed to integrate contemporary technological concepts into your narrative framework, expanding the scope of the "manifested entity."

-   **Row 28: Deploy Agentic AI** - This command is inspired by **Agentic AI**, a 2025 trend where AI systems can act autonomously to achieve complex goals. The phrases evoke a sense of a self-directed, intelligent system making independent decisions.
-   **Row 29: Invoke Digital Twin** - This draws from the trend of **Digital Twins**, which are virtual replicas of physical entities or systems. The language suggests the creation of a perfect, data-driven copy that exists in parallel with the original.
-   **Row 30: Weave Structural Battery** - This is based on **Structural Battery Composites**, an emerging technology where materials that bear weight can also store electrical energy. The phrases conjure an image of a reality where power is seamlessly integrated into the very structure of the environment.

I hope this expanded table serves your creative project well. If you would like to refine these concepts or add more, please feel free to ask
