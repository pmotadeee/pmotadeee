## Features

**Server management.** Launch llama-server instances with full parameter control, including cache checkpointing, speculative decoding, n-gram speculation, multimodal projections, and any custom flag you need. Per-model parameter overrides let you save the right settings for each model so launch is one click.

**Proxy.** An OpenAI-compatible endpoint proxy lets any chat app talk to your running servers. Server aliases route requests to the right backend, with optional auth and a built-in web server for the UI, so you can access host and warpdrv anywhere.

**Backends.** Register one or more `llama-server` builds — stock, custom-compiled, ROCm, CUDA, whatever — and group them for quick swapping. The Recipe Engine compiles fresh builds on demand using shared bash recipes.

**Models.** Browse and download from Hugging Face Hub directly inside warpdrv, with full download management. Local models are scanned, parsed, and organised into folders.

**Chat.** A built-in chat UI with threads, folders, and full sampling configuration. MCP server integration handles tool calling with per-tool permission prompts.

**Slash Commands.** Warpdrv comes with built-in slash-commands to perform tasks such as context compaction, using to-do lists, security and compliance guardrails using parallel adversarial local models.

**Voice** You can launch Whisper servers for STT and use KokoroJS for TTS. The are combined together in a powerful voice chat mode which makes every conversation feel like a phone call. Comes with 7 different voices.

## Install

### Linux (recommended)

Download the latest `.deb` or `.AppImage` from the [releases page](https://github.com/mikjee/warpdrv/releases).

**.deb (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint):**

```bash
sudo dpkg -i warpdrv_*.deb
```

**.AppImage (any distro):**

```bash
chmod +x warpdrv-*.AppImage
./warpdrv-*.AppImage
```

### Windows

Download the latest `.msi` installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/mikjee/warpdrv/releases).
> **Note: Recipes feature does not work on natively Windows as it relies on Bash scripts.**

### macOS

No prebuilt build yet. Build from source — see [For Developers](#for-developers). Untested on Apple Silicon; PRs welcome.

### First Run

On first launch, warpdrv shows an **onboarding welcome screen** that walks you through:

1. Adding a folder where your GGUF models live (or where to download them)
2. Optional: registering a llama.cpp build
3. A short slideshow of next steps (launch a server, start chatting, etc.)

Config and data are stored at `~/.config/warpcore/`. Survives upgrades — config is preserved across reinstalls.

### Updating

warpdrv checks for updates on startup and shows a banner if a new version is available. Click the banner to open the releases page, download the new version, install it. Your data is preserved.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install warpdrv** — see [Install](#install)
2. **Onboarding** — pick a models folder, optionally add a llama.cpp build
3. **Scan models** — warpdrv parses every GGUF in your folder. Alternately navigate to the Hub page to download a model.
4. **Add a backend** — point warpdrv at a `llama-server` binary; it auto-detects devices
5. **Launch a server** — pick a model, set GPU layers + context, hit Launch
6. **Open Chat** — pick the running server, start a thread, test the model

## How-To Guides

- [Recipes](docs/guides/recipes.md) — automating llama.cpp builds and other LLM-related bash tasks
- [Aliases](docs/guides/aliases.md) — routing addresses for servers behind the OpenAI-compatible proxy
- [Backend Groups](docs/guides/backend-groups.md) — swapping llama.cpp builds without re-configuring servers
- [Proxy, Remote Access, and Authentication](docs/guides/proxy-auth.md) — direct vs proxied access, bearer tokens, accessing warpdrv from another machine
- [KV Cache Checkpoints](docs/guides/kv-checkpoints.md) — saving and restoring slot state to skip prompt prefill

---

## Hardware Compatibility

### Tested Configurations

warpdrv works with any standard `llama-server` binary, so compatibility tracks llama.cpp's own support matrix.

### Backends

| Backend | Status |
|---------|--------|
| CUDA (NVIDIA) | Supported |
| ROCm (AMD) | Supported |
| Vulkan (any GPU) | Supported |
| CPU only | Supported |

### Notes

- Bring your own `llama-server` binary built against your hardware. The Recipe Engine can help compile one.
- Speculative decoding may not work with sliding-window-attention models.
- For GPU-specific build flags and runtime quirks, see the llama.cpp documentation for your target.

## FAQ

<!-- TODO local AI: tighten any answers, add more if obvious gaps -->

**Is this a daily-driver chat app?**
Depends. warpdrv is a workshop bench for testing models and llama.cpp builds. For polished daily chat, or coding, warpdrv's proxy server integrates seamless with your existing tools and workflows, and provides a customizable router using user-defined aliases.

**How does this differ from LM Studio / Ollama / Jan?**
Many server management apps bundle a fixed llama.cpp version and limits which models / quants work. warpdrv lets you bring your own llama.cpp builds — including bleeding-edge forks — and run them with full parameter control. Built for tinkerers, and also for end-users wanting a one-click chat app.

**Do I need to compile llama.cpp myself?**
No, but you can. warpdrv works with any standard `llama-server` binary. The Recipe Engine helps if you want to compile your own. Note: warpdrv does *not* ship with a llama binary, you have download one from the official github repo [LlaMa.cpp Releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases).

**Where is my data stored?**
Linux: `~/.config/warpcore/` — chat database, settings, MCP config, recipes. Models stay wherever you put them; warpdrv only indexes them. Your data never leaves your computer.

**Can I use warpdrv commercially?**
warpdrv is licensed under AGPL-3.0. If you offer it as a network service, you must publish your modifications under AGPL. For commercial licensing without AGPL obligations, join the Discord and PM the mods.

**Why AGPL?**
To keep the project genuinely open: derivatives stay open, including SaaS forks.

**Does warpdrv send my data anywhere?**
No telemetry, no analytics, no remote calls — except the update-check ping to fetch `release.json` from the GitHub repo on startup.

**Why is X feature broken?**
Alpha software. File an issue with reproduction steps. Better yet, send a PR :)

**Who made this app?**
A combination of AIs and human effort by one software developer. AI used were local Qwen 3.5 27b, Qwen 3.5 27b, Qwen 3.6 35b, Claude Opus 4.6 for planning and skeletons. This app itself was used to host the local LLMs during development.

**How long did this take to build**
Approx. One week for MVP. One month for initial public release.

## For Developers

### Architecture

warpdrv is a Tauri desktop app wrapping a Node.js server and a React frontend. The Tauri shell spawns the Node server as a sidecar binary on launch, monitors its health, and restarts it on crash. The React app talks to the server over HTTP + SSE.

### Tech Stack

- **Desktop shell** — Tauri 2 (Rust)
- **Frontend** — React 19, Chakra UI v3, Vite, Zustand, assistant-ui
- **Server** — Node 24, Express 5, better-sqlite3, better-sse
- **Bundling** — esbuild + `@yao-pkg/pkg` (server binary), Vite (frontend)
- **Shared types** — TypeScript-only `@warpcore/shared` package

### Monorepo Structure

```
packages/
  shared/   @warpcore/shared   — Types, enums, utilities. No runtime deps.
  app/      @warpcore/app      — React frontend.
  server/   @warpcore/server   — Express + SQLite. Process management, GGUF parsing, recipes.
  bridge/   @warpcore/bridge   — Composable chat engine (extracted, used internally).
  desktop/                     — Tauri shell + release scripts.
```

### Build From Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Node 24+
- Rust + Cargo (for Tauri)
- Linux: standard Tauri dependencies — see [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

**Steps:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikjee/warpdrv.git
cd warpdrv
npm install
```

**Run in dev mode:**

The recommended way is via VSCode. Open the repo, go to the **Run and Debug** panel, pick the `warpdrv-all` launch config, and hit play. All packages launch in a single integrated terminal.

If you don't use VSCode, run the same thing manually:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Release build:**

```bash
./release.sh                    # Linux .deb (default)
./release.sh deb appimage       # both .deb and .AppImage
./release.sh appimage           # AppImage only
```

Bundle formats supported by Tauri: `deb`, `appimage`, `rpm`, `dmg`, `msi`, `nsis`, `updater`. Pass any combination to `release.sh`.

Artifacts land in `packages/desktop/target/release/bundle/`.
