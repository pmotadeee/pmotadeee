Reviewing our entire conversation from the beginning, extract and organize all the subjects, topics, and layers of dialogue that make up our interaction.

List each main subject and, under each one, the conversational layers (subtopics, details, decisions, etc.) that were discussed.

Please present this clearly and in a structured way, so as to map the entire evolution of the dialogue.

Structure the output as follows:

- Main Subject 1:

* Layer 1.1: [detail]

* Layer 1.2: [detail]

- Main Subject 2:

* Layer 2.1: [detail]

...

Include all subjects, even if they were brief, and show how the conversation evolved from one subject to another.
